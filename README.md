# rflogs CLI

`rflogs` is a command-line interface tool for uploading and managing Robot Framework test results with the RF Logs service. It provides an easy way to integrate RF Logs with your CI/CD pipelines or local development workflow.

## Installation

Install `rflogs` using pipx (recommended) or pip:

```bash
pipx install rflogs
```

or

```bash
pip install rflogs
```

## Usage

### Authentication

Authenticate with the RF Logs service:

```bash
rflogs login
```

This opens your default web browser to complete the authentication process. Once authenticated, a token is stored securely on your machine for future use.

### Uploading Test Results

Upload test results after running your Robot Framework tests:

```bash
rflogs upload [OUTPUTDIR]
```

- `OUTPUTDIR`: Optional. Specifies the location of the test output files. Default is the current directory.
- The command does not perform a recursive search.

This command will:
1. Find relevant test result files (log.html, report.html, output.xml, and screenshots) in the specified directory
2. Compress output.xml using tar.gz
3. Upload all files to the RF Logs server
4. Provide a link to view the uploaded results

Example output:

```
$ rflogs upload ./results

### Downloading Test Results

Download test results to your local machine:

```bash
rflogs download <run_id>
```

This command downloads all files associated with the specified test result to your current directory.

Example output:

```
$ rflogs download 1234abcd
Downloading files for run ID 1234abcd...
  - Downloading log.html...    Done
  - Downloading report.html... Done
  - Downloading output.xml...  Done
  - Downloading screenshot1.png... Done
  - Downloading screenshot2.png... Done
All files downloaded successfully to ./rflogs_1234abcd/
```
### Deleting a Test Run

To delete a specific run:

```bash
rflogs delete <run_id>
```

This command will immediately delete the specified run and its associated files from the server.

## Configuration

`rflogs` uses a configuration file located at `~/.config/rflogs/config.ini`. You can edit this file to change default behaviors or set environment-specific options.

## Integration with CI/CD Systems

### GitHub Actions

To integrate `rflogs` with GitHub Actions, add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Upload Robot Framework results
  env:
    RFLOGS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RFLOGS_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    pipx install rflogs
    echo "Uploading Robot Framework test results..."
    output=$(rflogs upload ./results)
    echo "$output"
    echo "$output" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

Make sure to set the `RFLOGS_TOKEN` secret in your GitHub repository settings.

The `rflogs upload` command, when run in a CI environment, produces a simplified output optimized for GitHub Actions:

```
RFLOGS_RUN_ID=1234abcd
RFLOGS_OVERVIEW=https://rflogs.io/runs/1234abcd
RFLOGS_LOG=https://rflogs.io/runs/1234abcd/log.html
RFLOGS_REPORT=https://rflogs.io/runs/1234abcd/report.html
```

You can then use these outputs in subsequent steps of your workflow, for example:

```yaml
- name: Create workflow summary
  run: |
    echo "## RF Logs Test Results" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "âœ… [Results Overview](${{ steps.upload.outputs.RFLOGS_OVERVIEW }})" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "ðŸ“„ [Log](${{ steps.upload.outputs.RFLOGS_LOG }})" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "ðŸ“Š [Report](${{ steps.upload.outputs.RFLOGS_REPORT }})" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY

- name: Post links to PR comment
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    github-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    script: |
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.name,
        body: `## RF Logs Test Results for this PR
        - [Results Overview](${process.env.RFLOGS_OVERVIEW})
        - [Log](${process.env.RFLOGS_LOG})
        - [Report](${process.env.RFLOGS_REPORT})`
      })
```

### Other CI/CD Systems

For other CI/CD systems:

1. Install the RF Logs CLI tool in your CI environment
2. Set the `RFLOGS_TOKEN` environment variable
3. Run `rflogs upload` with the appropriate output directory
